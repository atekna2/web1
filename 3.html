  <h2>Epilogue</h2>
  <p>It makes quite an impact to see the two drawings together, making the finality of death hit home, with the absence of the loved one as emptiness. At the same time, the author gives hope that if we go to that spot the little prince might return: “If a child comes to you.” Saint-Exupéry challenges us to look for that magical child.</p>
