  <h2>Prologue</h2>
  <p>This strange parable, written as much for adults as for children, and beautifully illustrated by the author, has become a classic of our time. The narrator, an air pilot, tells how, having made a forced landing in the Sahara Desert, he meets the little prince.
  The wise and enchanting stories the prince tells about the planet where he lives with three volcanoes and a haughty flower, about his fight with the bad seeds, make him an entrancing, unforgettable character.
  Anoine de Saint- Exupery was a novelist and a professional air pilot. He wrote The Little Prince a year before his death in 1944.</p>
